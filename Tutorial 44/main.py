# File Management Script

# Create a Directory:
#     Use the os module to create a directory named RandomFiles in the current working directory.
# Generate Random Files:
#     Use the random module to generate 5 random filenames.
#     Each filename should be a random number between 1000 and 9999 with a .txt extension.
#     Example filenames: 1054.txt, 8762.txt.

# Write Data to Files:
#     For each file, generate a random number and calculate its square root using the math module.
#     Write the random number and its square root into the file in this format:
#         Random Number: 25
#         Square Root: 5.0
        
# Display the Created Files:
#     List all the files created in the RandomFiles directory using the os module.
