# Build a Simple Banking System

# Create a banking system using object-oriented programming in Python. The system should allow a user to perform the following actions:
    # 1.Check Balance: Display the current account balance.
    # 2.Deposit Money: Add money to the account.
    # 3.Withdraw Money: Deduct money from the account if the balance is sufficient.
    # 4.Exit: Close the application.
# Requirements:
    # Use a class BankAccount to represent the bank account.
    # Implement methods for each operation (check_balance, deposit, withdraw).
    # Use a simple loop to allow the user to perform multiple actions until they choose to exit.
